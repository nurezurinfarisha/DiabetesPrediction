# DiabetesPrediction

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a predictive model for diabetes using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and lIght BGM algorithms. The project aims to compare the performance of these two machine learning techniques in predicting diabetes.
## Table of Contents

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which contains the following features:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome (0 for non-diabetic, 1 for diabetic)

## Results

The project includes a comparative analysis of the performance of KNN and Random Forest algorithms. The results, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC.
